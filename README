To build the WAR file using Ant:

  $ ant build

And the WAR file will be located under "dist/pK.war". To deploy it usually you
just need to drop it under the "webapps" folder of the Apache Tomcat
installation directory.

After that you need to setup the MySQL database. You need to install it using
your system instructions, create a username and password, a database and set
those entries in the "src/hibernate.properties" file like this:

  hibernate.connection.url = jdbc:mysql://the.hostname/thedatabase
  hibernate.connection.username = the_username
  hibernate.connection.password = ThePassword

You'll also need to uncomment the following line to create all needed tables
into your database in the first time you run. Just uncomment it, start the
server, try to login once, comment it back and then restart the server.

  hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto = update

After that you're ready to go! ;)
