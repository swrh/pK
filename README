To build the WAR file using Ant:

  $ ant archive

And the WAR file will be located under "dist/pK.war". To deploy it usually you
just need to drop it under the "webapps" folder of the Apache Tomcat
installation directory.

After that you need to setup the MySQL database. You need to install it using
your system instructions, create an user with a password and a database:

  mysql> create database dbname;
  mysql> create user 'username'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
  mysql> grant all privileges on dbname.* to 'username'@'localhost';
  mysql> flush privileges;

Add those settings to the "src/hibernate.properties" file like this:

  hibernate.connection.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost/dbname
  hibernate.connection.username = username
  hibernate.connection.password = password

You'll also need to uncomment the following line to create all needed tables
into your database in the first time you run.

  hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto = update

Just uncomment it, start the server, try to login once, comment it back and
then restart the server.

After that you're good to go! ;)
