# pK

This project started as a real application used in 2011 but now is just a hobby for me. It is under constant modifications and is not safe to use in production. I'm constantly replacing frameworks it depends on, rewriting its structure, redesigning its user interface and even changing the languages in which it is written. It is pratically a sandbox for me to try new and different web technologies.

If you want to know more about the changes I've been doing, please take a look at the *History* section.

## History

In 2011 this project was written, released and deployed using Java, Struts and MySQL. It was released as version [1.0](https://github.com/swrh/pK/tree/v1.0) and the only language supported was Brazilian Portuguese.

In 2017 I started rewriting it using Ruby on Rails, but after sometime I deleted the unfinished code. It was in a different repository.

In mid 2021 I updated it using newer framework versions but it still has some big bugs. It was released as version [1.1](https://github.com/swrh/pK/tree/v1.1) and its branch is [release-1.1](https://github.com/swrh/pK/tree/release-1.1).

In late 2021 I decided to start rewriting it using newer technologies. I'll probably use React on the frontend, but I still haven't decided how the backend will be written.
