# pK

This project started as a real application used in 2011 but now is just a hobby for me. It is under constant modifications and is not safe to use in production. I'm constantly replacing frameworks it depends on, rewriting its structure, redesigning its user interface and even changing the languages in which it is written. It is pratically a sandbox for me to try new and different web technologies.

If you want to know more about the changes I've been doing, please take a look at the *History* section.

## Intro

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## History

In 2011 this project was written, released and deployed using Java, Struts and MySQL. It was released as version [1.0](https://github.com/swrh/pK/tree/v1.0) and the only language supported was Brazilian Portuguese.

In 2017 I started rewriting it using Ruby on Rails, but after sometime I deleted the unfinished code. It was in a different repository.

In mid 2021 I updated it using newer framework versions but it still has some big bugs. It was released as version [1.1](https://github.com/swrh/pK/tree/v1.1) and its branch is [release-1.1](https://github.com/swrh/pK/tree/release-1.1).

In late 2021 I decided to start rewriting it using newer technologies. Currently I'm trying Next.js.
